# Plugin updates

Plugin updates are checked and committed automatically, but tested and deployed by developers. When there's one for you to do, you'll get a ticket.

## Process

1. Check out the update branch that's specified in the ticket: ```git checkout <branch>```
2. Install the updated plugins: ```whippet plugins install```
3. Fire up the site and do some testing. Click around the site, check areas of functionality that are powered by particular plugins that were updated (eg buddypress, eventbrite), try to get a good random sampling
4. If you find problems, fix them. If you can't, update the ticket with what you found and assign to someone who can. If you learn something about the site that is generally useful, update its readme
5. When you are happy that the site is working, merge the update branch and deploy it
6. Finally, add a comment on the ticket to say what testing you did, and what fixes you made, if any.
