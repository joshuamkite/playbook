# Card sorts

**Things you'll need:** Index cards, post-it notes, pens, a large table, 4-5 participants

**Estimated time:** 60 minutes

## Best to use when

Card sorts are a good way to figure out how information or transactions should be organised so that most users will understand where to find things.

## Instructions

1. On the index cards, participants write labels representing subject areas of user need, interest or existing pages.
2. Participants then group the cards and give each group a name. You can prepare some group names before the day, or just let participants make them up.
3. Talk to participants to understand why they have grouped things they way they have
4. Ask participants to rank the groups in order of priority

## Examples

TODO: we need some photographs and example outputs.
