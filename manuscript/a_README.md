# dxw Playbook

***Are you looking for the playbook? Read it [here](https://github.com/dxw/playbook/blob/master/playbook.md)***

There will be an HTML version, but there isn't yet.

## What is this?
It's dxw's playbook. It explains how we get things done.

## Changes
The playbook documents how the playbook gets changed. See the [changes to this document](https://github.com/dxw/playbook/blob/master/playbook.md#changes-to-this-document) section for more information.

## Structure of the repo

### playbook.md
This is the main playbook. Unless there's a good reason, we should record all process and policy here.

### research_activities
Each research activity that we do has its own page in this directory.

### guides
This section contains more detailed documentation on how to do things. It's mostly aimed at developers, but can contain any detailed documentation on a specific task or subject. Like research activities, this is quite detailed and isn't of general interest, so it gets its own section.

## Style
These documents are maintained by everyone at dxw, and it's important that their quality and tone is consistent.

### "We" vs "You"
The document primarily talks about what "we" do. If you can phrase what you're saying in these terms, do. If it sounds weird, or you're actually talking about what an individual needs to do in a given circumstance, use "you".

### Links
Link liberally, both within the document and to useful things on the web. Don't reinvent the wheel - if someone else has already written up a great explanation of something that we agree with, just link to it.

### Small is beautiful
This is a long document. Try to avoid making it too much longer. Keep things simple. Don't use flowery language or unnecessary words.

### Plain English
This document is for everyone. If you find yourself talking about something specialised or technical, you're probably in the wrong place. Should you be writing a guide?

### Openness
This is a public document, because it's good to be open. But some things are private. You can put them in the private playbook, when we have one!

### Headings
Use second level headings for main sections, third for subsections and fourth level ones if you need to. Don't use fifth or first level headings. The table of contents in the HTML version is automatically generated, and it assumes this structure.
